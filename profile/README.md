## User Voices, Platform Choices: Social Media Policy Puzzle with Decentralization Salt

This project explores the dynamic interface between user preferences and platform policies in social media, emphasizing the potential for decentralized policy-making. Our research investigates how varying degrees of decentralization in policy enforcement can affect content moderation practices and user satisfaction. We propose novel methodologies for leveraging user input to create fairer, more transparent social media platforms.
